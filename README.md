# a tiny whale

This is a simple tiny [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitops/tinywhale) container. It is meant to show the absolutely bare minimum thing you have to do to start a docker container with a web process inside it.

Thank you to [elgohr](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-docker) for the GitHub action that publishes new changes to DockerHub.
